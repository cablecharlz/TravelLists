				What is Trip Notes?

				Trip Notes is the place to capture and organize your travel ideas by yourself and with others.  Planning a trip can be messy and overwhelming, so we built Trip Notes to help people make sense of their travels and ultimately, have better travels.

				Trip Notes is new, and we'd love your feedback on how to make it better.
